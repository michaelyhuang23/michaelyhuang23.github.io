        <h3>Hi!</h3>
        <p>
            I am <span class="tooltip">Michael<span class="tooltiptext">Yihao Huang, 黄翊皓</span></span>! So what does that mean exactly? I don't know either and I'm still finding out. For now, I'm a high school student interested in <i>CS</i>, <i>physics</i>, <i>writing</i>, and more recently, <i>math</i>. I'm learning to do research. My past works have focused on <span class="tooltip">algorithm designs<span class="tooltiptext">I did two years of research in parallel algorithms under the PRIMES program. In 2021, my partner and I developed a parallel algorithm for bi-core decomposition. In 2022, I developed a parallel clustering algorithm for Density-Peaks Clustering</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">applicative machine learning<span class="tooltiptext">In 2021 Summer, I worked at Prof. Scheutz's Human Robot Interaction lab to integrate an object detector AI model into the robotics system. In 2022 Summer, under the Research Science Institute (RSI) program, I worked at Prof. Necib's astrophysics lab to develop novel graph neural network based clustering algorithms for stellar substructure identification.</span></span> in physics and robotics, but I'm hoping to get into machine learning research with a more mathematical taste in the future. I also enjoy writing about <span class="tooltip">physics<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://intuitivephysics.me">Intuitive Physics</a></span></span> and <span class="tooltip">(political) philosophy<span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://daylightreveries.substack.com">Daylight Reveries</a></span></span> as a way to discharge my thoughts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as <span class="tooltip">Venus de Milo<span class="tooltiptext"><img src="assets/images/venus.jpg" style="height: 300px;"></span></span> would be incomplete without two slightly incongruous arms, a personal blurb would be deficient without an origin story. Way before doing research, I <span class="tooltip">fiddled with robotics<span class="tooltiptext">I did WRO, FLL, FTC, and VEX robotics (no I won't explain the acronyms). I led a robotics team in middle school and again now in high school.</span></span>. When I got locked away with a computer during the pandemic, I got bored and became a <span class="tooltip">competitive programmer<span class="tooltiptext">I did USA Computing Olympiad and also some other smaller contests. I attended USACO camp in 2022 Summer. I also co-founded The Andover Computing Open</span></span> (and also began physics blogging). It was through competitive programming that I was introduced to doing research in parallel algorithm designs. Then, I started doing more research, particularly in AI. <span class="tooltip">By some will of the universe<span class="tooltiptext">Some say humans have free will. Others, myself included, disagree. We live in a deterministic universe with the only indeterminism introduced by quantum uncertainty. In a way, we are drifting in a windless ocean, subject to only the random flutterings of waves–––the will of the universe. Each decision we make is not an exercise of our free will, but a valuable experience to understand ourselves–––our most intimate ideas and dreams.</span></span>, I came to the realization one day that we live in a very screwed up time with a lot of <span class="tooltip">existential threats<span class="tooltiptext">misaligned/unaligned artificial general intelligence, nuclear annihilation, climate change, e.t.c.</span></span>. And that was when I began to find interest in (political) philosophy and writing.
